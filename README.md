# TaiwanCovid
Here is where I'll put any data analysis I do about Taiwan's current covid outbreak
- The fastest way to figure out how I'm making these maps is to look at these two files:
  - covid_528_script.R 
  - Covid_528.Rmd 
- Everything else is either data, dependencies, or scripts used to make older maps
